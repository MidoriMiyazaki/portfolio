          <p> <span class="tab"></span>Thank you for visiting my website.

            I am currently a student majoring in Web Development. I will finish the program in Spring of 2024.
            I have learned <span class="bold"> HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, C#, and .NET</span> so far. I have a strong passion
            for Web Development, especially frontend because I like creating something from scratch.
            I love learning new scripts and am open to entry-level positions.

            I was born in Japan and since 2020 I have been living in the US. Presently, I am based in Santa Rosa, CA.
            <br>
            When I was in Japan, my profession was ICU nursing.
            As an ICU nurse, I have experienced working with not only nurses but also several different medical staff in
            a fast paced, intense situations. Working as a team member, I was trained how to communicate with others
            effectively to solve issues patients were facing.
            I would say I am good at working in a team, very punctual, and diligent to complete tasks.
